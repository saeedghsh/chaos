# Chaotic Systems

Python implementation and exprementation with few simplistic chaotic systems.
<!-- Also intended as an scaffold for starting python projects. -->

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --length 100 --count 500
python main.py -h # for help
```
where:
  * `--count` (default: 1000) is the number of processess plotted at the same time.
  * `--length` (default: 50) is the maximum time.

## laundry list
* [x] gererate chaotic processes via logistic maps
  - [ ] reproduce all the plots from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map)
  - [ ] use [Tent map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_map) instead of "Logistic map"
* [ ] the 2D plot from the derivative of the process: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(x,y)=(dX_{t}, dX_{t %2B 1})">

* [ ] double-rod pendulum
* [ ] Lorenz attractor
