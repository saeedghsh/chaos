# Chaotic Systems

Python implementation and exprementation with few simplistic chaotic systems.
<!-- Also intended as an scaffold for starting python projects. -->

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --length 100 --count 500
```
for help:
```bash
python main.py -h
```

## laundry list
* [x] gererate chaotic processes via logistic maps
  - [ ] reproduce all the plots from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map)
    + [ ] frequency spectrum
    + [ ] [Bifurcation diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram)
    + [ ] [cobweb plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobweb_plot)
  - [ ] use [Tent map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_map) instead of "Logistic map"
  
* [ ] the 2D plot from the derivative of the process: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(x,y)=(dX_{t}, dX_{t %2B 1})">
